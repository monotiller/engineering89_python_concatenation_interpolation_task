# Concatenation and interpolation
Welcome to this short demonstration of concatenation and interpolation

To make things organised this task has been split in to 3 files;
- `concatenation.py` which demonstrates concatenation in python
- `interpolation.py` which demonstrates interpolation in python
- `refactor.py` takes the code from the past two files and adds the refactoring specifications

There are comments that walk you along the code to help you better understand what's going on!

## `title()`
So why am I using `title()` over `capitalize()`? Well, `title()` has support for capitalising each word in a sentence. This automatically makes it a lot more useful for full names since I don't have to use loops to split up the word!
